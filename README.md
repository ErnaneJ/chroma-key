# Chroma Key JS âœ¨

Image viewer based on the idea of a chroma key, which offers real-time viewing and filtering capabilities directly on the client. This system allows the user to activate a grayscale filter and add the Sobel algorithm for edge detection. Furthermore, its main functionality consists of exemplifying the basic functioning of a chroma key, using any color provided by the user, and also providing the option of rendering an image in the desired location.
